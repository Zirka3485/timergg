# TIMER.GG

TIMER.GG is an all inclusive timing website for all things League of Legends. The application itself is completely **voice activated** and features both visual and verbal feedback for all timers. This hands-free approach not only saves time, but also aims to minimize distractions and helps keep your focus on the important stuff. You can time almost anything:


* Summoner Spells
* Baron
* Dragon
* Scuttle Crab
* Inhibitors

## Getting Started

After a quick tutorial, you'll be introduced to the **Player Dashboard**, a dynamic interface that responds to your voice commands. As you time, the dashboard will record and display your information instantaneously - no fussing with typing out things ingame or fumbling over manual controls. Though the dashboard is entirely voice activated, you can always use the interactive GUI to control everything on the dashboard. Along with visual displays, the dashboard is also equipped with **Voice Assist**, providing you with verbal reminders when your cooldowns are almost up.

## Extras

TIMER.GG also features a few **extras** that you can equip that aim to improve the core fundamentals of wave control and map awareness, along with some nifty modifications to the dashboard:


* Map Awareness Ticker: Every beat reminds you to take a quick look at your minimap
* Cannon Wave Notifier: Alerts you when a cannon wave leaves the base
* Map Display: Interactive map of the rift that you can use to trigger objective timers
* Ally Team: Enables timing of your allies summoner spells and interactive player banners
